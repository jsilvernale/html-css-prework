            <p>As you can see my name is Joshua Silvernale. For the longest time
                I didn't know what I wanted out of life.  I was just going along without 
                any real direction.  I went  to college for a couple of years, and after those
                years I realized that school, in its traditional sense, was just 
                not for me.  I also worked at ralphs from age 15 to age 21. While I was going to
                school and working at Ralphs I had a lot of fun.  I'd do things with friends a lot
                and it would always be a blast, but I was lost. For six years I was lost.  It was
                in that sixth year that I decided I couldn't keep doing this! I had no money and 
                no career!  My decision was to become a personal trainer!  My career started at
                crunch fitness.  I worked there for a while before I started training independantly.  
                This is where I met the love of my life and the woman that I would eventually get married to.
                After working as an independant trainer for a few years I started to realize that 
                training isn't what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.  So I went back to crunch
                so I could have a steady place to work while I figured out what I was going to do. Before
                I knew it though, the pandemic was here.  Oddly enough this is when my girlfriend, at the 
                time, and I decided to get married and move our lives to Texas.  Even though I didn't 
                want to train anymore it was the only thing I was qualified to do. So in order to go 
                to Texas we both needed to find jobs and a place to live.  This is when I started
                working at Cannon Fitness.  I was there for about a year and a half when I started to get
                that feeling again that I needed out of this industry. It just wasn't making me happy. 
                I quit and started working at a company called Starpak.  While there I was looking into this "coding"
                thing. I had no idea what it was or what it entailed. As I was looking into it I found that 
                it's on the computer! I loved being on the computer.  Also, that a specific field uses it 
                to develop video games! Let me tell you. I played video games A LOT back
                in the day and I mean PLAYED VIDEO GAMES.  I lost my life to World of Warcraft for about
                five years, I played a game called Maple Story for a couple years and I lived on 
                x-box live for a few years.  So there it was. Software engineering it is! I enrolled myself at
                coding temple and have been learning ever since. What I've learned so far I have absolutely
                fallen in love with! I couldn't be happier, and I know I'll be a great asset to any
                company that I work for!
