            <h1>High School and College</h1>
            <h2>Savanna High<br>2008</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Savanna in 2008 with a cumulitive gpa of 3.6.</p>
            <h2>Fullerton College<br>2008-2010</h2>
            <p>This was my first attempt at college.  I took way to many classes
                and overloaded myself because I thought it would be as easy as 
                high school, but boy was I wrong.  I left here with a cumulitive 
                GPA of 2.7
            </p>
            <h2>Santa Ana College<br>2010-2011</h2>
            <p>I went here next to try to refocus.  I started playing baseball again
                with the hopes that it would help me focus a little bit harder on
                school.  Again I was incorrect.  I left here with a cumulitive GPA now
                at 2.0
            </p>
            <h2>Saddleback College<br>2013-2014</h2>
            <p>This was my final attempt at College. It didn't go so well, and I ended
                up stopping with a final cumulitive GPA at 2.0. I just didn't have the
                motivation to get up super early to drive 40 minutes to class to sit
                for three hours.   
            </p>

                <h1>Personal Training Certifications</h1>
                <h2>I.S.S.A(International Sports Science Association)<br>2012</h2>
                <p>This was my first pt course that I took that led to me gaining
                    a wealth of knowldge.  Maybe not from this cert specifically, 
                    but it sparked my interest in the field.
                </p>
                <h2>NASM(National Academy of Sports Med)<br>2014</h2>
                <p>This was my second certification. This was the standard for 
                    personal trainers.
                </p>
                <h2>Corrective Exercise Specialist<br>2015</h2>
                <p>This is when my love for troubleshooting human movement started
                    to blossom.  This course taught me the basic troubleshooting techniques 
                    that I would build upon during my career as a trainer.
                </p>
                <h2>Human Movement Specialist<br>2016</h2>
                <p>I took this course to further my knowledge and love for human
                    movement.  This was an indepth analysis of the human movement
                    patterns and lots of ways to troubleshoot and correct them.
                </p>
                <h2>Integrated Manual Therapist<br>2018</h2>
                <p>This was a course that was very hands on and luckily had a couple
                    awesome clients that would let me practice on them.  Any time that
                    had sat for to long or slept wrong or were in pain for any reason
                    I would use these manual techniques to help release muscles that would
                    allow for better and pain free movement.

            <h1>Software Engineering</h1>
            <h2>Coding Temple<br>2021-2022</h2>
            <p>This is my first experience with any kind of Software development.
                All I knew about this before I started was that it involved computers
                and troubleshooting.  I have already started to fall in love with the
                process and can't wait to expand my knowledge.
