                <h1>Working Out</h1>
                <p>I love to workout.  Something that I fit into my every day life.                    I enjoy powerlifting and olympic lifting exercises.  This is 
                    something that I do with my wife, and in the future I hope to 
                    do it with my daughter!

                <h1>Snowboarding</h1>
                <p>Snowboarding is probably one of my favorite activities to do 
                    that I don't get to do nearly enough. Being that I live in Texas
                    there really isn't anything near me.  Another thing that I can't 
                    wait to teach my daughter.

                <h1>Video Games</h1>
                <p>Video games have been a hobbie of mine since I was a kid.  It all started
                    with the lion king on sega genesis.  From there it blossemed to the 
                    Nintendo 64 and made its way to the computer. Maples story was my first 
                    real computer game that I played.  Then came xbox.  This is where I really started to 
                    get heavy into gaming with HALOOOOO! I would be on xbox live with friends
                    till the wee hours of the morning. Then I was introduced to a much more
                    complicated video game called World of Warcraft or WoW for short.  This 
                    is the game that I probably invested most of my time into. Towards the end 
                    of my WoW era I just couldn't find time to play video games any more.  Now I 
                    just play mobile games.  The two that I play most are Clash royal and Dota
                    Underlords.  They are fun but it's just not the same as being on a computer.
