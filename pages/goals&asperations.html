    <div id="why">
        <h1>This is my why</h1>
        <p> First and foremost I am a God fearing man.  I try to live my life as an honest 
            person who always wants to do the right thing.  Second, I am a family man.  
            I have my wife, my stepdaughter, my newly added daughter and my 4 legged daughter 
            that make me want to be a better person everyday. I want to be able to provide 
            for my family and spend as much time as possible with them.

            <h1>Main Goal</h1>
            <h2 class="comp">Software Engineer</h2>
            <p>This is my biggest goal at the moment. I want to learn as much as I can and become
                as fluent as possible in all the coding languages!  I want to be able to create
                things that nobody has seen before.  When people look at my stuff I want them to
                be absolutely blown away! I know what this entails, and I can't wait to put in 
                the work for it!

            <h2 class="food">Fitness</h2>
            <p>Even though I have stopped training in person I am still all about helping educate
                people on how to live a healthier life.  I want to give people something that 
                makes incorporating fitness into their life easy. There are two main things that 
                people need to do in order to have a healthier life. The third thing I am going
                to show is just to make life easier with the first two.

                    <li>This is the main and most important part of living a healthy lifestyle.
                            There are so many places out there that take all the work out of thinking
                            about what you need to eat.  If you are interested just click on 
                            nutrition above and it will show you just one example of what I am
                            talking about.

                <ul>
                    <li>Working out is so important.  People always talk about "oh man, you
                        dont want to get old. It sucks.", but what a lot of people don't 
                        understand is if you just workout you can fight a lot of those
                        negative side effects of getting old. I personally workout at 24
                        hour fitness.  Go ahead and check them out if you are interested. 
                        Just click the Working out link above.

                <ul> 
                    <li>Most people don't even know where to start when it comes to eating right
                        and working out nor are they in the slightest bit interested in learning about it.
                        That is where I come in.  I have put together a few different
                        programs for people to purchase so they don't ever have to think or 
                        learn about this fitness lifestyle that they have no interest in. It's not
                        expensive and it's just a monthly membership style and you can cancel at anytime.
