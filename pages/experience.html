                </h2>        
                <p>This was my first couple years in the industry! Mainly
                    focused on helping people lose weight and increase their
                    cardiovascular endurance.
                </p>
                <h2 class="independant">Elevated Fitness<br class="date2">2014-2019</h2>
                <p>I then when on to work as an independant contract trainer.
                    I figured this way I could make more money and work less hours.  
                    Working less hours gave me the ability to focus on each individual
                    client more.  This is where I found my love for troubleshooting
                    and correcting basic human movement patterns. I started to develop
                    my knowledge for corrective and rehability methods.
                </p>
                <h2 class="crunch2">Crunch Fitness<br class="date3">2019-2020</h2>
                <p>This is about the time I had realized I had fallen out of love with
                    training and no longer wanted to do it as a profession. I ended up back
                    at crunch fitness where I no longer had to worry about all the things
                    that went along with running your own business and just focus on training.
                    It was at this time that I knew what I wanted out of this field. Then hit the 
                    pandemic!

                <p>I worked at Cannon Fitness and Performance for about a year and a half.
                    It was about the year mark when I started to feel that stuck feeling and
                    wanted out.

                <p>This was something that I needed to do. I worked with chemicals and
                    plastic rolls.  Time management was huge and attention to detail was
                    also a big part of it.

                <h2>Coding Temple</h2>
                <p>I don't have any professional experience with coding, but 
                    I will be well on my way with coding temple as a start to 
                    my career.  I've learned SO much already and cannot wait to
                    learn so much more. This is just the tip of the ice burg and
                    any employer who takes a shot on me is going to have someone
                    that is very hungry to learn, and who is very willing to work
                    hard to get ahead.
